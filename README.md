# Teaching Spring

This is simple project that is used as a base to teach others spring. Branches are various steps
of teaching various Spring frameworks (MVC, Data etc).

Eventually, I may refactor this and have submodules for each teaching step (bean initialization via XML then bean initialization via Annotations, adding Spring Data, adding Spring MVC and so on.)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

A local mysql instance is required for a few branches where an actual DB connection is used. It should be exposed on localhost:3306.
Since we will never release this to production we use 'root' and 'admin' as username and password.
